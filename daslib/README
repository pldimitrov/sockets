1. cd to  daslib/lib/i386_Linux

2. Edit Makefile. Modify
   DASLIB	= .... the path where you installed daslib

3. make

4. To run, the daslib calls also need a server
   process running on some local machine.
   You need to specify which host and port in a file on a well-known
   location (e.g. on the shared file system or replicated across
   all machines).
   This file should be named in daslib/src/das_inet/das_inet_sync.c,
   where you should specify das_srv_location as the name of the file
   that contains the hostname and port number where the server process
   runs.

   That file should contain the line:

   <.... the host of where your server process runs ...> 3456

   The server process is a Java program (no less!) Prun_server.java,
   found in DASLIB/prun-server.
   Just keep it alive forever on your specified server host.
